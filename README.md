# ChillPills-App
Orbital 2022 Team 5334 Hello, we are Wan Lin and Aatmika from Team 5334.

This is our Orbital application, ChillPills.

# Note for Testers
Do note that it is an iOS application due to the usage of an iOS-exclusive external library. iOS emulator set-up and environment is necessary.

# Motivation 

As the saying goes, life is a marathon, not a sprint. We have to pace ourselves properly so that we have enough energy for the long road ahead of us. Many studies have shown that taking breaks (5 to 90 minutes) in between study or work routines can positively affect attention abilities, improving focus and productivity. In particular,new research suggests that 17 minutes is the optimal break time with 52 minutes of work. There are many activities that can be done during the break to re-energize the body, such as going for a walk or a run or having a chat with a loved one. Even a five-minute meditation session has a great positive influence on your mental health and gives us clarity. 

However, the hyper-competitive culture in Singapore has inculcated the ‘work-hard, play later’ mindset into students and workers, leading to high stress and burnout rates. As students ourselves, we have become fearful of incorporating breaks into our routines as we are afraid that such ‘lost’ time could have a negative impact on our academic performance, leaving us vulnerable to burnouts and mental breakdowns.

If we can’t remind ourselves to chill, why not have something else, perhaps a little genie in your pocket, to encourage and incentivise us to take breaks and recommend activities for us to do to unwind and relax regularly?

# Aim 
We hope that with our application, users will be able to incorporate regular breaks into their routines and perform activities that improve their mental and physical health, which in turn helps prevent burnouts.
